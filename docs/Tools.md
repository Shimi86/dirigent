# Tools
Tool is a user definable executable that can be started
 * From Dirigent's UI menu
 * From a script

Tools are defined in `LocalConfig.xml` where their executables and command line arguments are specified.

Tools share same definitions as Apps in the `SharedConfig.xml`.

The tools can be referenced from `SharedConfig.xml` in the form of [Actions](Actions.md).
