# Local Config

### Agent's local config file

Agent's local config file contains configuration that is specific for an agent (for example folder watching settings). Each agent can use its own local configuration.

Local configuration is stored in the `LocalConfig.xlm` file. The location of the file can be set through application option `localConfigFile`.

Local configuration file is optional.
