Support for applications that are never started automatically, just manually.

Support for disabling an application before starting a launch plan.

Support for multiple retries when launching a problematically starting application.

Failure timeout for boot up detector.

Support for application window attributes (hidden, minimized, maximized, topmost, always on top, position, size)

Prevent multiple instances of agent with the same name (machineId:port)

[REJECTED] Run server process om master machine automatically on agent start. Reset the server process if server already running.
[DONE] Allow for non-windowed mode (console app for linux, windows service).
[DONE] Extract the preparation of agent configuration into a separate class and use it for non-windowed mode.
[DONE] Separate main GUI form into a reusable library, requiring just IDirigentControl.
[DONE] NetworkOperations to use just IDirigentCOntrol instead of LocalOperations.
[DONE] Two flavors of GUI - one with embedded agent and one that connect remotely to a session without starting its own agent instance.

[DONE] Make the master know the shared config and provide it to agents. Synchronize shared configuration upon connection to master. Resolve conflicts with locally stored config.

[DONE] Make shared config at agent optional. Make the use of it only until the connection to master is estabilished.

[DONE] Make the master know the current lauch plan and provide it to agents. Agent loads it upon connection to master.

[DONE] Add log4net logging. In non-windowed mode, log the exceptions using log4net.

[DONE] Add command line options to specify the config files, initial launch plan to follow etc.

[REJECTED] Server as windows service (maybe through a 3rd party service loader app??) Or just TrayApp will be used instead? Service would allow starting processes on without any user logged in (which is not much useful).

[DONE] Combine multiple operational modes into one single agent app (local, networked, tray GUI app...)

[DONE] Create commandline tool for sending commands to agents.

[DONE] Support for autorestart of app after unexpected termination. Add crashed app to launch sequencer when crash is detected..
